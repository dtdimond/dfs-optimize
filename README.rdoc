This is a daily fantasy lineup optimizer, meant to be used for assisting with creating entries for Draftkings, Fanduel, and Yahoo daily fantasy football games.

It takes player projections and salary information from FantasyFootballNerd.com and computes the optimal lineup for each site using RGLPK, a linear programming optimizer.
